			<h2>Issues</h2>
			
			Brisbane, like many cities around the world, faces a range of environmental issues that require attention and action. One significant challenge is air pollution, resulting from vehicle emissions, industrial activities, and other sources. This pollution not only affects the health and well-being of residents but also contributes to climate change and degrades the quality of the air we breathe.

Another pressing concern is the loss of green spaces and habitat fragmentation. As the city grows and expands, natural areas are often cleared for urban development, leading to the displacement and fragmentation of wildlife populations. This loss of biodiversity impacts the ecological balance and disrupts the delicate ecosystems that support a healthy environment.

Water pollution is another issue of concern. The city's waterways, including rivers and creeks, face contamination from industrial waste, stormwater runoff, and improper disposal of chemicals and waste. This pollution can have detrimental effects on aquatic ecosystems, as well as on the health of marine life and the overall water quality.

Additionally, Brisbane, being prone to extreme weather events, faces the challenges of climate change. Rising temperatures, increased frequency of heatwaves, and changes in rainfall patterns pose risks to both human populations and natural environments. The impacts of climate change include more frequent and severe droughts, floods, and other extreme weather events, which can have far-reaching consequences for the city's infrastructure, ecosystems, and overall resilience.

Addressing these environmental issues requires collective efforts, from government initiatives and policies to individual actions. It is essential to promote sustainable practices, such as reducing carbon emissions, conserving water, protecting natural habitats, and fostering environmental awareness and education. By working together, we can help mitigate these challenges and create a more sustainable and resilient future for Brisbane and its residents.
